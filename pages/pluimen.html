                    Pluimen was a coupon based gift shop, that wants to have a customer branded ‘premium’ shop. This is because of some 
                    legislation that makes having a closed off company branded environment interesting for certain customers. It was up 
                    to us to figure out a way to stay true to Pluimen, but also brand the store towards customers’ own branding (think 
                    IKEA, Deloitte etc.) within the technical constraints of the backend.

                <h2>What is a Pluim?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Pluim (roughly translates to praise or compliment) is a gift card that is usually given in a Christmas care-package, 
                    a dutch custom where employers give their employees a box of usually luxury goodies such as wine, smoked salmon and chocolates 
                    as a Christmas present.

                <h2>The Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Pluimen wants you to think of their card as an experience. Most of the things you can buy on their sites are also in this 
                    spirit. Most of their product range consists of hotel stays, activities and diy products. As such they dislike displaying 
                    prices and want their premium environment to work with a point system.

                <h2>The Design Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    How do I create a Christmas themed, customer branded premium environment for companies, while staying true to the Pluimen 
                    experience, within hard technical constraints that inhibit the editing of certain aspects of the site?

                <h2>What can we do?</h2>
                <p>
                    While brainstorming we came to the conclusion we could basically only do this through setting ‘themes’ that would shift the 
                    colours of the site towards a ‘premium neutral’ with whites, grays, and blacks, and then brand certain aspects like content 
                    fields and buttons in the colours of the premium customer. Changing the serif and script typefaces wasn’t possible because of 
                    the backend, so color themes is basically the only thing we could do.

                <h2>My recommendations moving forwards</h2>
                <p>
                    Making the neutral premium shop improved the site already, increasing clarity and readability of a lot of components while 
                    reducing visual clutter, mainly in the footer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main recommendation would be to move away form their current backend towards one that supports more in depth editing and 
                    allows them to be more creative and expressive in their pages. The other one would be to abolish the point system they use 
                    instead of actual currency. This is more of a user centric point of view, but distinguishing between products and their value
                    becomes increasingly more difficult as we try to hide what you're actually paying for a product. People can probably still find 
                    out if they search hard enough, but that may also let them find discrepancies in the pricing.
