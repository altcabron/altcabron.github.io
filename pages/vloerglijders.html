                <h2>Wishes</h2>
                <p>Vloerglijders' current site is aging rapidly, so they came to us for a redesign. They didn't have a lot of specific wishes in mind, but did provide us with some examples of web pages they like.</p>
                <p>
                    One of the inspirations they named was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudpillo.nl/">Cloudpillo <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a>, a Dutch pillow brand with modern aesthetics.
                    Another example was another Dutch brand, <a target="_blank" href="https://upfront.nl/">Upfront <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a> which focuses on healthy 
                    replacements for a lot of types of food found in the supermarket, protein powders, and other workout related products. And finally we also had 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a> (another dutch brand ;)) the popular hotel-booking site.

                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>
                    My first step was blocking out some different variations of designs by looking at what content would go where on the page with some wireframes. 
                    I tried to explore similar but visually distinct looks that fit the brand and the inspiration they had provided.

                <h2>Visuals</h2>
                <p>
                    Looking at their inspiration I decided for a more youthful/instagram look for their visuals, and tried to mix more interior design images 
                    with more 'candid' photography to make it appear younger. Seeing how this is still a more conceptual phase I wasn't afraid to let it be more 
                    'stock-y' with images.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Conceptual Redesigns</h2>
                <p>
                    In the end the three concepts came together nicely in the exploration phase. The next step would be to work out the designs more in depth 
                    according to their wishes and what they liked best.
                </p>
                <h3>Concept 1: Booking</h3>
                <p>
                    This first concept was the one more in the style of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a>. This meant more color blocking, and more images. To differentiate more between the different 
                    designs I did forgo any rounded edges for a more corporate feel.
                </p>
                <img src="../static/img/project/vloerglijders/vloer-headline1.png">
                <p>
                    Something I did in all the design to make the product images stand out more is cut away the background so the product photography could be more part fo the design.
                    This lets you customize the product card more, in this case I decided to still use a blocked out background, but in theory they could be completely standalone.
                </p>
                <h3>Concept 2: Cloudpillo</h3>
                <p>
                    Something I really wanted to explore here is mixing sans serif and a more cursive serif in one sentence, which is what <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudpillo.nl/">Cloudpillo <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a> 
                    does in their styling. The page itself is quite minimalist, where the images do most of the speaking. Similar to Cloudpillo I did try to elevate the design through 
                    the use of some fun shapes to break up the design here and there.
                </p>
                <img src="../static/img/project/vloerglijders/vloer-headline2.png">
                <h3>Concept 3: Upfront(ish)</h3>
                <p>
                    Concept 3 is in a style reminiscent of <a target="_blank" href="https://upfront.nl/">Upfront <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a>. This 
                    design is more simplistic than the others, due to the fact that images and text are more separate from eachother rather than implemented into a single component. 
                    This creates a calmer and somewhat indie feel.
                </p>
