                <p>
                    Hey, I'm Guido. I'm a UX/UI Designer from Amsterdam. I have a passion for design with my current focus being on accessibility. 
                    In my spare time I'm a big nerd who enjoys D&D, Magic the Gathering, reading, music, board and video games and winter sport.

                        <p>
                            During my time at Shopmonkey I mainly worked on UI elements and pages that had pre-established designs. 
                            As the sole designer I was responsible for all the day to day design needs.

                            Elastique is a Cloud native Digital Development agency. They had some work piling up and a designer with a broken arm who couldn’t work 
                            at full capacity. They hired me for a three month period to progress a couple of their projects forward. After three successful months 
                            there just wasn’t enough work to retain me fulltime.

                            IAMCore is the Study Association of CMD (my study). Here I was the Chair for one of the Commisions, namely the Game Commission. Our task 
                            as Commission was to plan game events at the university. We’d plan the entire event and manage setup, catering and lead  tourneys. As the 
                            Chair it was up to me to lead a team 5 others to make sure everything ran smoothly.

                            As part of my study I completed a 6 month internship at ABN AMRO, one of the biggest banks in the Netherlands. Here I worked with the Private Banking 
                            team, and worked mainly on the Design System revamp.

                            Lemoncake was a small agency in Amsterdam Noord. During my second year of CMD I interned here for about two months. During that time I mainly worked 
                            on the Lemoncake website and some other sites via Wordpress.
